Support, Advocacy, Community

## Who we are
Diverge is student run startup founded at Dalhousie University. We provide support for students living with diagnosed or undiagnosed mental health conditions, neurodivergence, or identify as a caretaker/family member. Further, we advocate and strive to make change in these communities. Supporters and those wanting to expand their knowledge on the topic are always welcome.

## What we do
We prioritize the wellbeing of our community through both connection on-campus and online. We have forever evolving goals, with our current being the creation of a funding aid for caregiver students at Dalhousie University.

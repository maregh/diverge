Support, Advocacy, Community

## Who we are
Diverge is student run startup founded at Dalhousie University. We provide support for students living with diagnosed or undiagnosed mental health conditions, neurodivergence, or identify as a caretaker/family member. Further, we advocate and strive to make change in these communities. Supporters and those wanting to expand their knowledge on the topic are always welcome.
